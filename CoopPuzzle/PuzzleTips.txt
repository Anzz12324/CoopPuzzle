Weighted Switch Puzzle. Switch A is a Pressure Plate which opens Door B. 
However, Switch A will only keep Door B open if weight is continuously put on it. 
This sometimes involves pushing a block or other convenient heavy object on top of the switch. 
Sometimes you need to use an item—for example, an ice-based power to freeze a local puddle of water or enemy; 
then you push the resulting ice block over to the switch. 
Sometimes a party member or NPC ally must stand on the switch.

Tile Flipping Puzzle. Or a "switch light puzzle," on occasion. 
Hitting a switch or Ground Pounding a tile causes it and two close (or related) tiles to turn over. 
You must flip them all over, sometimes within a time limit. 
This also covers all variations where you must set all members of object X to state Y, 
when action Z causes nearby members of object X to switch states.

Hamiltonian Path Puzzle. In short: a puzzle where you have to step upon all of the unlit tiles in a particular grid, 
but you can only step on each tile exactly once. 
This usually results in you spending a ridiculous amount of time experimenting or just going and looking up the answer.

Spelling Bee Puzzle. You have to spell out something, usually the name of an important character, with unconventional means. 
Usually you have to trigger switches with letters written on them to spell out the name, often in a time limit. 
Sometimes part of the puzzle is realizing what it is you need to spell.
